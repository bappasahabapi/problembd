## ❤️ How to contribute

Use pull requests to contribute to the project.

### Adding a New Company
If the company eg `Generic Company Ltd` is not in the list, then create a new file for the company in `/docs/` folder eg `generic.md`, then add that in the table of contents in `/docs/.vitepress/config.mjs`. In the json file, find the items in themeConfig.sidebar.items. And add your new entry here. If you feel like this is too much hassle, then just mention it in the pull request. I will add it later.

```json
items: [
    ...
    {
        text: 'Generic Company Ltd', 
        link: '/generic'
    } 
    ...
]
```

The `generic.md` might have the following sections
```
# Generic Company Ltd

## Introduction

## Interview Stages

```
### Contributing to an Existing Company
Else list the interview question under that company section. If the question is already added in other company section but not under the company you are currently wanting to contribute then too you can add the question.

### Question Answer Format
Stick to the following format to add a question under a company:
```html
<details>
<summary>
[Question]
</summary>
<hr>
[Answer]
</details>

Example:
```
