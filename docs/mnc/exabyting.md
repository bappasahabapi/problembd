## Introduction

## Interview Stages

For the Trainee Software Engineer Position, Exabyting follows a 4-stage interview process.
They often give job advertisements on LinkedIn. We have to apply using the Google form mentioned in the post. In the Google form, some questionnaires about yourself and some basic technical questions are given sometimes. I applied several times through the Google form but never got a call. Last time, I applied through a referral from an employee of theirs and got shortlisted. The interview process is as follows:

1. **Phone Interview:** After applying and getting shortlisted, one of the employees will call you and ask you some basic questions about Computer Science.
2. **Round 1:** The first round is a technical round and generally lasts for half an hour. An engineering manager will join in this stage and ask about you, your hobbies, currently what are you doing and some basic questions.
3. **Round 2:** The second round is also a technical round. This interview session is taken by 3 software engineers and runs for around one and a half hours. In this round, they ask you about your projects, your role in the projects, and some technical questions. They will ask questions based on your recent used tech stack.
4. **CEO Round:** This is a behavioural interview with the CEO of the company. In this meeting, he briefs you about the vision and mission of the company. What is the long-term goal of the company, what is their expectation from the company and what is your expectation from the company? He also briefs about the culture of the company. He tries to understand whether you are aligned with their company culture or not. He also asks if you have any preference for any department like backend, frontend mobile application etc.

**Problem Statement:**
You'll be given two strings A and B, with lengths 1 <= length <= 10^6. The strings will contain only 1's and 0's. To make A a good string, you can insert B into A at any place, as many times as you want (or don't insert if you don't want). You have to print YES or NO depending on whether making A as a good string is possible.

**The Definition of GOOD:** A good string will never consecutively have two 1's or two 0's.

**Input/Output:**
The input will consist of two strings in two lines, strings A and B.

The output must be only one word, "YES" or "NO".

**Sample Input/Output:**

| Input            | Output |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| 101<br>010       | YES    |
| 111<br>010       | YES    |
| 1110011<br>01010 | NO     |
