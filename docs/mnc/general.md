For fresher roles almost all the companies ask about `projects` and `thesis` done in university. So, it is a good idea to take a refresher on them before going to the interview. `Hackathon experienc`e and other hobby projects are also encouraged.

## B.Resume
Instead of creating a resume from scratch by yourself, try using a template. You can find good tested templates on the web. If you just follow the basic template and change the information you get a pretty good starter. You can find a good latex resume template [here](https://github.com/arasgungore/arasgungore-CV). Follow the guidelines presented [here](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/technical-resume-tips) on how to write contents of a resume. Don't keep it too long or too short. It is usually not necessary to add images.

- Canva is great a tool to create cv

> [!TIP]
> Modify your resume (if needed) before applying to a new position tailoring for that specific role. It helps yourself to stand out from others.

## C. Portfolio

> [!TIP] ðŸ’¡
> You can't add everything to your resume. As it is better to keep resume as short as possible, many of the things need to be left out. So, it is a good choice to create a portfolio website. Add all your information there. Add a link of the portfolio to your resume. This way if your recruiter wants to know more about you, they can check the portfolio.
